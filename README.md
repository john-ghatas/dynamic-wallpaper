# Usage
Clone the folder in an accessible location (/home/$USER), and point to the .xml in each folder in Gnome Tweaks

## Recommended method
A script is supplied in which the background is automatically copied to the path defined in the XML which is `/usr/share/backgrounds/gnome/`. This method requires no changing of the XML file

## Important 
Edit the paths in the XML to point to the correct location of the wallpapers
